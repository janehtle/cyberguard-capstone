# 🛡️ CyberGuard 

**Problem Statement:** Many individuals are unaware of daily cybersecurity threats or how to respond to them effectively. Traditional training is often "boring," text heavy, or too technical for beginners. There is a need for fun, engaging, and simple cybersecurity education that teaches people how to recognize and avoid common risks. CyberGuard addresses this gap by using a quiz based game with real situations users may encounter, making cybersecurity education accessible, interactive, and memorable.

# Overview
